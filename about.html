	<p class="what-we-do-text our-story-intro">More than one of us has had our athletic career cut short due to injury. While we can't get back the opportunities we missed, we can chart a different path for others. We have lived the emotion of being injured on the sidelines and understand how untreated injury affects the body and mind into adulthood. We also realize that not every athlete currently has access to professional care.</p> 
	<p class="what-we-do-text our-story-intro">Through our injury prevention and rehabilitation programs, <strong>we are committed to keeping talented young athletes in play so they have more opportunities</strong> to attend college and excel in life.</p>
